Version 1.0 - 12/11/2016, Guildford Travelodge, 01.01am 

Installation:
Open SuperCollider, and in main window type 'Quarks.gui' and press Ctrl+Rtn - this should load Quarks. 

In Quarks, find 'Dirt-Samples' and click on the title. In the lower window, click on 'Open Folder..', this will open the Dirt Samples Folder. Copy and paste the 8 folders BSBass to BSVocals directly into '../Dirt-Samples'. Do not copy and paste audiofiles without this one layer folder structure. Once folders are copied, restart SuperDirt (by typing SuperDirt.start and Ctrl+Rtn). The samples will then be ready to use an fully 'installed' into the Dirt sample library. Use the samples as you would with any dirt sample by typing '[folder-name]: [number]'.

Sample use:
The samples are broadly divided into similar instruments, but BSNoise and BSPerc are more mixed. Within the folders, samples are grouped into songs, with the shortest one-shot samples first, into longest. We advise that you look inside the folders for the descriptive titles of each sample. Some samples are long and will loop round if you're not careful, but it sounds nice, so who cares.
